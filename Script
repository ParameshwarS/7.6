1. Write a macro in pig to filter out the people with age >45 from the below given dataset.

DEFINE macr_o(rlnvar,agevar) returns result{

$result = filter $rlnvar by $agevar > 45;

};

a = LOAD '/home/acadgild/olympix_data.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, country:chararray, year:chararray,
close_date:chararray, sport:chararray, gold_medal:int, silver_medal:int, bronze_medal:int, total:int);

op1 = macr_o(a,age);
dump op1;


2. Find out the number of medals each country won in archery.

a1 = FILTER a by sport == 'Archery';
grp_country = GROUP a1 by country;
op2 = FOREACH grp_country GENERATE group AS country, SUM(a1.total) as c;
dump medal_count;


3. Find out the number of medals india won year wise.

a2 = FILTER a by country == 'India';
grp = GROUP a2 by year;
